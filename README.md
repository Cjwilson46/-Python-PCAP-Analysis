This Python script processes PCAP (Packet Capture) files to extract and report network traffic information. It provides details on each unique connection and the ports observed in the data. This tool is useful for network analysis and cybersecurity purposes.
Features

    Connection Extraction: Identifies unique network connections including source and destination IPs and ports.
    Port Observation: Lists all observed ports with the count of packets that used each port.
    Report Generation: Generates a text report for each processed PCAP file detailing the connections and ports.
